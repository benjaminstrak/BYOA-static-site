# A Beginner's Guide to Training Your Llama

Training a llama is a rewarding experience that strengthens your bond with these intelligent creatures. Here's what you need to know to get started...

## Start with Trust

The foundation of any llama training is building trust. Spend time around your llama, letting them get comfortable with your presence. Offer treats occasionally, but don't force interactions.

## Basic Commands

Llamas respond well to consistent, gentle training. Start with these basic commands:
- "Stop" - Essential for safety
- "Come" - Useful for feeding time
- "Back" - Important for handling

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Moving too fast with training
2. Using negative reinforcement
3. Forgetting to reward good behavior

Remember, every llama has their own personality. What works for one might not work for another.
